#This is a project for defect detection.
# The data used in this project can be found on
 #https://conferences.mpi-inf.mpg.de/dagm/2007/prizes.html and for augmneting it you can run CreatingImageDataAugmentation.


#If you want to create the model then run  IndustrialDefectCNNDataSplitAugmentation,py or IndustrialDefectCNNDataAugmentationRandom.py as one of them does random split and the other does manual split.

#If you want you can run saved model within models folder and in order to evaluate run EvaluatingCNNModel or run EvaluatingTransferLearningModel and the results would be saved in an excel file.

#In order to run multi calss defect detection MultiClassDefect.py and EvaluatingMultiClassDefect.py.

#You can run TestModelWithImageLabel in order to see the results with image and labelled defected or not defect.
